    "# Seasonality\n",
    "Seasonality in time series refers to regular and predictable patterns that repeat at fixed intervals or cycles over a given time period. These patterns often occur due to external factors, such as weather, holidays, or cultural events, and can significantly impact the behavior of the time series data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Seasonality is typically characterized by the following properties:\n",
    "\n",
    "Regularity: Seasonal patterns exhibit a consistent and predictable repetition at specific intervals. For example, if you have monthly sales data, you may observe higher sales during certain months each year.\n",
    "\n",
    "Fixed Duration: The duration of a season is constant and repeats over the time series. It could be daily, weekly, monthly, quarterly, or even yearly.\n",
    "\n",
    "Consistent Amplitude: The magnitude or amplitude of the seasonal effect is relatively stable across different cycles. For instance, if you analyze quarterly revenue data, you may consistently observe higher revenues during the holiday season each year."
